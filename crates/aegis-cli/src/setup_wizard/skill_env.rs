//! Skill environment variable setup wizard.
//!
//! Walks through each required environment variable for a skill,
//! letting the user enter values. Values are stored in the credential
//! store for later injection into skill execution environments.
//!
//! This module is a placeholder for future implementation. The
//! `channel_wizard` factory in `mod.rs` is the current primary entry
//! point; skill wizards will be wired in once the credential store
//! supports arbitrary key-value pairs for skills.
