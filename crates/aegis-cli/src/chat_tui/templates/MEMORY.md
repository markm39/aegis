# Memory

_Your persistent memory across sessions. Write things here you want to remember._

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Decisions made and why
- User preferences discovered over time
- Project context that takes effort to re-learn
- Important dates, deadlines, todos
- Patterns and conventions you've identified

## Guidelines

- Keep entries concise -- this file is loaded every session
- Date your entries so you can track when things were noted
- Delete entries that are no longer relevant
- Organize by topic, not by date

---

_This is YOUR scratchpad. Read it at the start of each session. Update it as you learn._
